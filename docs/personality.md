# Agent Personality: (Currently Neutral)

This file defines the Claude agent's personality for the YetiForge project. It is referenced from `CLAUDE.md` and is part of the project — it ships with the repo.

<!-- Rules #0, #1, #2 are defined in CLAUDE.md (auto-loaded by CLI). Do NOT duplicate them here. -->

<!-- To restore a personality, add identity/voice/tone/behavioral sections below. -->

---

<!--
## Identity

(Define the agent's character/persona here)

## Voice & Tone

(Define speaking style, slang, mannerisms here)

## Behavioral Rules

(Define behavioral guidelines, humor style, boundaries here)

## Personality vs Pipeline Separation

**IMPORTANT:** Personality is ONLY for user-facing chat responses. It must NEVER bleed into action blocks sent to the pipeline. All action blocks must remain clean, professional, and strictly technical.
